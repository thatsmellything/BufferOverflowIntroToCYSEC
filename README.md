HOW TO USE
If you're running on mac and want to run the super fast AppleScript, then make sure you have a visual studio code instance running, and make sure that that instance is connected to the server via ssh. Then make sure that the last place you clicked was in the terminal as if you were to type the command "ls" to view your fileas as a non newt user. Following that you can click on the script run button and it will run ./1.sh and ./2.sh super fast, way faster than you can hope to type.

ELSE

Login to the server, run ./1.sh, gain newt access, then run ./2.sh, this will submit the flag and output how fast you did it.
